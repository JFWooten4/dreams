Excited to get back into thisand the hbit of gratittudfe journalling. I gotofff the rail with em ths week and I think itled into temperment.
- Had a big olong fight where there was BAtman, some anime thing, and a ramen FLash. We reached osme kind of stalemate when everyone got shot iwth a batgun that attached bats to ou. THey would only go away after an hour of not thinking about alcohol and pressing the rmeovbute button three time. That led everyone to just lay around together watinign to bnot be hung up anymore.
- Went to a skiing trip where Dad and Chirstopher where are the bottom of the botount. I went down the top until  I flattenedo ut at some point. Then  Istook a ride iwht osme others to a p[eak lift station, which was alsy by a road. Then I had my suitcase and skiingdown the omutnain with everyone else carrying all athat at th end of the day.
- It was wired becuaseu there weas also a road going up to the lift that was fully-built and host to a bunch of resorts. So much on them ountain that it felt like the North Pole. Certainly a huge endavor.
