Man had a lot of dreams last night, but i feel com[letely wrecked around the wake-up sequence, and accordingly I hesitate greatly to get out of the bed. A small small part of it could be the attachment every morning from K, but I think the larger part is a lack of spontenuity. I've ha a really tough time sleeping this week becaue of prop 98, and I seriosuly need to and will start distancing myself from the community chats there (again, first time in 2022). 

On the bright side, I finally set up a bedside tbale, and now it's just a means of drawer organization to have aspot to put he laptiop for instantenous re crding. SO things should start getting better :)

I've been trying to communicate more sriously ithout the emoji use, but sometimes in notes to self it just helps communicate well. I sweare there was some big dream last night about glboal-scale climate and orgnaization stuff, but seriosuly just beyond me this mornign to recollect. I hit over 9hr last night given absolutely wrecked my sleep Thurrsday worrying about the liqudiity incentives. Thankfully, I;m learning finally to let go of others' mistakes and finally focus on mending for a better future.
