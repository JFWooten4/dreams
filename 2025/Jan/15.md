First of all, I just want to say that I appreciate deerly the abilit to mange capital, in all its forms. Nohing else even comes close to the thrill of isolated, silent, analytic trading:
- Was in some kind of movie where we were proably legos, trhinig to break into a secret war garage. Then the whole thing cut into a Nick Cage TV show where we were travellling throjg an abndoned desert compond at nigt by helicopter.
- Was stuck alone in a Costco at night ravnging raound the ojuter edges of the store. At some points, it also felt like the middddle of a normal store, looking throjgh the glass sliding doors
