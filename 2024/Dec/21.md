Busy few mornings, so my bad on the missings; been a lot of dinosaurs lately:
- Forgot quite a few, but the last one was evading a dinosaur inside a hotel. Had to use all the clever tricks I could to get from the lobby back to my room without being eaten. Needed to use brains to outsmart with family, stealthily getting back to the safety of a strong lock.
- Dream about being a kid and shopping around with mom for a day. Helped with groceries and picking things out, only to realize at the end that the dollars we used were worth like twice the same price today. Lol got Chris a $2 muffin pack he wanted at Walmart, only to later realize that it would be the equivalent of like $5!
