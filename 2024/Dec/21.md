Busy few mornings so my bad on the nmissings; been a lo of dinarsours lately:
- Forget quite  a few, but he last one was evading a dianrsour inside a hotel. Had to use all the clever tricks i could to get from the lobby back t my room without being eaten. Needed to use brains to outstampt with family, stealthily getting back to the safety of a stong lock.
- Dream about being a kid and shopping around with mom or  a day. Helped with grovceries and picking things out, only to realize at the end that the dollars we used were worth like twice the same price today. Lol got chris a $2 muffin pack he wanted a Walmart only to later eealize that it would be the requive of like $5!
