Great cuddling last night in closing out private intensifications recently:
- Last dream was back in a classroom, which I thankfully haven't had in a while. I was sitting next to Christian again, whom I haven't seen in some time. We were trying to pick up dropped pencils and art things to return them to owners.
- When packing lunches to go to school with Christopher, I ran out of time and ended up scarfing down some nuts and stashing them away as sole food for later. I've felt like this for some time as I lived off Sam's bulk items in 2023. Thankfully, I'm able and happy to move towards food abundance now.
- Earliest dream and interim were good, but I forgot them. Two wake-up sparsings last night, in all likelihood caused by light carbs and meat yesterday. Know the deadly combo, and I slightly overreacted to yesterday.
