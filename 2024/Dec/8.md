Great cuddling last night in closing out private intensificatijons recently:
- Last dream was back in a classroom, which I thankfull haven't had in a while. I was sitting next to Christain again, whom I haven;t seen in some time. We were trying to pick up dropped pencels an d art thigns to retunr them to owners.
- When packing lunches to go to school with Chrsitopher, I ran out of time and end up scarfing down some nuts and stashng them away as sole food for later. I've felt like this for some time as I loved off Sam's bulk items in 2023/ Thankfull I'm able and happy t omove towards food abundance now.
- Earliest dram and interim were good, but I forgot them. Two wake up sparsings last night, in all linkiklihood caused by light carbs and meat yesrerday. Know the deadly combo, and I slightly overreacted to yesterday.
