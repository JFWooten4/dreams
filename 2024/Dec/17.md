- Moved to some older community and was making everyone tea. Beforehand, I was on a starship flying around in a pod with a robot. I got there because I was heelying too fast on Earth.  
- Was walking around some downtown area when we hopped on the train to speed around. Just barely managed to get on one leaving the station. That was after I saw someone driving around on a cart for a maintenance food delivery.  
- Also thought about different rail options in the same corridor. Was exciting to see things flying in sync. And got to see Coach Z cheering on my wheeling again lol.
