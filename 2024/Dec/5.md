Starting to get some stuff inspired by Dr. Stone - so thanks K lol!
- Kinda wierd thing were only a certain percent of people turn to stone, but it's only like temporary when they;re doing something. Then when loved ones approach htey unfreeze only to share what can save them (specificto ea. person) before freezing back up again. Main character was someone in a talent show akin to B Bennson.
- Next one I tried to fly to old H.S. on a Saturday sing my matress (been a long time for good reaon lol). I get about 60% there very slowly, butthen a large updraft sweeps me into a major river, which deposits me at an export manufactuirng okant. There is a robery there of sorts where pople clmb out of the water to steal metal prob.
- something lse but rought time in the early hours last night be final time cut
