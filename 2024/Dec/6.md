-	I ran a cross-country race and passed a lot of friends in an open field. All I did was open up my stride and run parallel to the dirt course through the grass. But then I got stuck, slowing down as I approached the top of the final hill, which is common.
-	I remember gliding down an old neighborhood on Heelys, accelerating afterward. There were a lot of desserts and celebratory pies offered, but I abstained. All eyes seemed to turn back to me once I returned to the finish line.
-	Another common dream surfaced, but I managed to move through it. The last thing I recall was my finger crossing the finish line. I need to burst through with confidence as a standard approach.
