- Some extended sequence about defending the base from an attacker. Lots of extended action sequences about team fight scenes. Constantly needing to figure out who's on my team versus a spy for the enemy.
- A lot of guns at play, which K would probably say is a boy thing lol. Just can't help it if that's how all the movies go. I enjoyed my standard position as the endgame sniper.
- Forgot the rest again whoops. I was thinking it'd help to keep my laptop next to me in bed. I also recall being the most aware in the group about the pending adversarial setup.
