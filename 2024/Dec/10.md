- Some extended seucne about defending base form an attacker. Lots oextended action sequences about team fight scenes. Constantlty needing to figure out who's on my team v. a spy for the enemy.
- A lot of guns at play, which K would prob say is a boy thing lol. Just can't help it if that's how all the movies go. I enjoyed my standard position as the endgame sniper.
- Forgot the rest again whoops. I was thinkign it'd help to keep my laptop next to me in bed. I also recall ebing the most ware in the group about pending adversarial setup.
