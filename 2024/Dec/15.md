- Busy couple of mornings, so my bad on the last ones.
- Dreams about longstandingness and social webs tonight. One where I was in a random city going about my own business. I remember taking an Uber from the hotelier near the train station.
- Went to some parks and interweaved through local halls. When I got back to the parking lot, it seemed the car I took in with interesting graphics was now being used by some other group.
- They had it jam-packed, and I asked if I might join on the way back. Then we all just walked towards the middle of town through the side streets. Had to prove myself to the social group by discussing past struggles with a focus around my parents' identity.
