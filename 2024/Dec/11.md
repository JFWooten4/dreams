- Had a scneece where Dad was still around with Mm and we were goig to school after some kind of road trip. We stopped at a parking area gas station and found ourselvs around a pool resort area. Dad made us go into the party place and flrth with some young ppl.
- I just stayed inthe car, but CHrisopher had fun. Then after the rest stop we brought them back to school for some reason ,I htink t=we trapped htem in their car onaccident so they needed a ride. When we got called to admin office for displipline, there was just anotherparty with everyone and their grandpa since yay fun.
- I had another schoolish-one, similarly about admin during the younger primary years. There was a lot of defiance against central control, which is interesting since I used to be pretty compliant to the system. Perhaps things changed onece I realized the meaninglessness of it all, assumign you want to work outside of theoretical academia.
