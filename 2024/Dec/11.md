- Had a scene where Dad was still around with Mom and we were going to school after some kind of road trip. We stopped at a parking area gas station and found ourselves around a pool resort area. Dad made us go into the party place and flirt with some young people.
- I just stayed in the car, but Christopher had fun. Then after the rest stop, we brought them back to school for some reason. I think we trapped them in their car on accident, so they needed a ride. When we got called to the admin office for discipline, there was just another party with everyone and their grandpa since yay fun.
- I had another schoolish one, similarly about admin during the younger primary years. There was a lot of defiance against central control, which is interesting since I used to be pretty compliant with the system. Perhaps things changed once I realized the meaninglessness of it all, assuming you want to work outside of theoretical academia.
