- Dream abouta big fiasco aroudn parking for a downtown CLT football game. We had to go somewhere super far away, near the middle of some forested area. Then I got to take a train into town. The first train i saw was was a funny stema engine, and I ended up boarding a horse-lengthened card ride next to Chirstopher on the rails. We reahed civilization and had to navigate our walk to the stadium basedo n local landmarks and pins. Quite the adventure setting everythign up. Almost felt like we were ridding a wriggler on rails, and I loved seeing the other powerful relics.
- Some college guy thought he was above the rules, and they convinced the teacherof a class to get them a special desk setup. It let them park their bike right outside the class with one wheel still attached to the person. This got in everybody's way forsome reason or another, and was generally extremely annoying. Then some kid in the class asked the teacher if they expected special treatmentt to go to school, and they replied "no." This convinced them that the student should need to park their bike like everyone else rather than create a huge distrractionwith their priviledged method. SO they had to go back to using the same system as others and integrat into the social norms of a standard interface.
