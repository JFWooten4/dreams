Smoethgni seems to be brewng basedon ast few, albeit harder o recall the originals:
- Last dreasm was of a competition of osrts where our side of the vertcal court had two teams facin goff. We generally orked together to gather materials in an efortto survive and carefully dig fown to an extraction holle that needed to be completely dried out form its wetness. eWe dug to get hroughthe ground and also earned monopolymoney to use at a nearby store where we were transported to a select set of options avaliable for trade. I recall waiting ages for the register to checkout as the machine didn't wokr veyr well and others kept jumping ahead in the quee.
- Cn;t recall the others, although I won in the water departmet thanks to iligent effort. Some night distressing cotisol. Still seem to struggle aganst diffusing second winds. Hopefully I cns master the intentional removal of invenous  cortisol.
