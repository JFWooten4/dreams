Something seems to be brewing based on past few, albeit harder to recall the originals:
- Last dream was of a competition of sorts where our side of the vertical court had two teams facing off. We generally worked together to gather materials in an effort to survive and carefully dig down to an extraction hole that needed to be completely dried out from its wetness. We dug to get through the ground and also earned monopoly money to use at a nearby store where we were transported to a select set of options available for trade. I recall waiting ages for the register to checkout as the machine didn't work very well and others kept jumping ahead in the queue.
- Can't recall the others, although I won in the water department thanks to diligent effort. Some night distressing cortisol. Still seem to struggle against diffusing second winds. Hopefully, I can master the intentional removal of intravenous cortisol.
