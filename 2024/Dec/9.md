Few ones I generally remember from before, or could easily extrapolate from growing up. Probably stayed up too late yesterday snice I hit at least 9:
- Went to mall and waited in the car for most of it. Then I drove to the end of things to find a lunch outnig. Got tangled up with the pirate legion leader bukateering around there lol.
- Had a choice as to whether or not to take some kind of allowancefrom a parent. I think it was Mom, and I remmeber being so excited abot it because it was 6% of something ather than 4. I'm glad to be economically free of them now, just for the sake of being able to shamelessly work on the passions I know are so key to our society.
- Something earlier on in the night, which again i struggle to keep in emmory. Perhaps I;ll need to some of natepad next to the bed. Bu tthis requisites waking up in th emiddle of the night which is a bad thing so...
