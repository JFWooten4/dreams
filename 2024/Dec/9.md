Few ones I generally remember from before, or could easily extrapolate from growing up. Probably stayed up too late yesterday since I hit at least 9:
- Went to the mall and waited in the car for most of it. Then I drove to the end of things to find a lunch outing. Got tangled up with the pirate legion leader buccaneering around there lol.
- Had a choice as to whether or not to take some kind of allowance from a parent. I think it was Mom, and I remember being so excited about it because it was 6% of something rather than 4. I'm glad to be economically free of them now, just for the sake of being able to shamelessly work on the passions I know are so key to our society.
- Something earlier on in the night, which again I struggle to keep in memory. Perhaps I'll need to keep some notepad next to the bed. But this requires waking up in the middle of the night which is a bad thing so...
