-	Walked out of a cold courtroom to chat with the prosecutor about a case on DTCC as related to protecting investors. Got some vague responses as they walked away in an alley leading up to dark shadows, matching their complexion. But they dropped a book frozen in ice, which I thawed out with my tongue and kept for safekeeping.
-	Went down a ski lift slope over and over again at the bottom of the mountain. A very small, basic run where I was explaining to K the requisite fundamentals. Kept riding it back up, thinking about the larger adjacent lift with the same principles.
- There was some kind of larger fight, where I played some key sourcing role as an alchemist of sorts in a library. The school was always angry since Iâ€™d find precise ingredients by comprehensive analysis, rather than buying all the possible ingredients through blind instruction. Somehow it brought us to a final scene where I used the tools to protect someone important who was attacked symbolically to provoke outrage amidst a crowded battlefield. Then support rained in from above, shielding our cornered brawl just as RD entered the field on the tail end of a sonic rainboom inside the tornado.
