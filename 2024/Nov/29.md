- I had a teleporting gun that also turned me into a ghost. I went around spooking people and generally using my powers for innocent mayhem. Then, at a much later date, I picked up the tool again, but it didnâ€™t seem to work. I endeavored to find new batteries for it from a stranger, only to find it still dysfunctional. But then I reconnected with the source of the machine, finding that it was partially severed years after I built it for study by others. They proclaimed that it should have taken an expert doctor or a career of sorts to build the same tech and felt unable to handle its scientific particularities. But I just played around with it for a few seconds and had everything back up and working in no time.
