Another night with some old friends nad thoughts:

- Last dreas was about prepping for some kind of sporting copmetition. The biggest takeaway was how we were prepring for a swimming competiion. Everyone was standing around strategiing how to be the fastest, while I was hte only one jumping into the pool and practiing antually swimming for days on end.
- ext were a small series based on running some kind of viking civilization so to speak in primative times. The biggest thing I remember was prepaing for some kind of join civilization collaboration and defense battle of osrts. I sawa lot of my freinds there with everything I enjoy material and food-wise, where I acted as a leader of sorts taking first blood in some kind of defensive capital position.
- SDome other things earlier-on in the night. But had to awaken for water at some p[oint, as I'm having a tough time staying up on my intake of at least 2.5 gal with family affairs going on. I swear it was something around communal tgrowth of sorta, though.
