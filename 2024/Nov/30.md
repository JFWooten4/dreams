Another night with some old friends and thoughts:

- Last dream was about prepping for some kind of sporting competition. The biggest takeaway was how we were preparing for a swimming competition. Everyone was standing around strategizing how to be the fastest, while I was the only one jumping into the pool and actually practicing swimming for days on end.

- Next were a small series of dreams based on running some kind of Viking civilization, so to speak, in primitive times. The biggest thing I remember was preparing for some kind of joint civilization collaboration and defense battle of sorts. I saw a lot of my friends there with everything I enjoy material- and food-wise, where I acted as a leader of sorts, taking first blood in some kind of defensive capital position.

- Some other things earlier on in the night. But I had to awaken for water at some point, as I'm having a tough time staying up on my intake of at least 2.5 gallons with family affairs going on. I swear it was something around communal growth of sorts, though.
