This is an old repo designed to originalylly promotre transprency into my subsconcsous thoughts. I believe we can all agreee that dreams replect ro a lage degree our ulterior motives and deepest espires, in one form or another. By sharing these without cenroship, I thought it would disclose what to me some would consider material inside information. 💜

Upon further reflection, I;ve gound this to be an unproductive use of my time. It has bgotten me into the habbit of drafting wokr each morning, potentially sketching downdaily goals, nd in general remembering my dreams (which is probably a good ting). But while these are nice things, they aren't really useful for the general observer - and they're especially nto as impoirtant as the actual pending work on my plate.

I'm deprivcatng this for now out of an interest towards action . We need so direly financial systems and decentralized prodcutes which serve everyone. 🌌 And i don't thnk my dinky personal morning mini-log here helps anyone get closer ot that. 🫱🏼‍🫲🏽
