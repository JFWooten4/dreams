This is an old repo designed to originally promote transparency into my subconscious thoughts. I believe we can all agree that dreams reflect to a large degree our ulterior motives and deepest desires, in one form or another. By sharing these without censorship, I thought it would disclose what to me some would consider material inside information. 💜

Upon further reflection, I've found this to be an unproductive use of my time. It has gotten me into the habit of drafting work each morning, potentially sketching down daily goals, and in general remembering my dreams (which is probably a good thing). But while these are nice things, they aren't really useful for the general observer—and they're especially not as important as the actual pending work on my plate.

I'm deprecating this for now out of an interest toward action. We so direly need financial systems and decentralized products that serve everyone. 🌌 And I don't think my dinky personal morning mini-log here helps anyone get closer to that. 🫱🏼‍🫲🏽
